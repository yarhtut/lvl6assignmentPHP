							<h1>About Us</h1>
							<h2>Food for thought</h2>
							<p id="yar">Looking after your family and making sure they get the best quality food, from producers you trust can be a struggle. 
							There are multiple stores to visit, traffic to fight through and questions about where produce really comes from.
							And that's all before you've wasted even more time in endless supermarket queues. As a busy mum with a hungry family to feed, I wanted great quality local food I could trust without
							the hassle of visiting different stores or different websites. I basically wanted a farmers' market on my doorstep. I figured others would to, so I started Urban Harvest.
							</p>
							
							<h2>Real food. Real easy. Delivered to your door.</h2>
							<p>At Urban Harvest we make life simple. We've handpicked the best local producers and foodmakers to bring you delicious new ingredients and store-cupboard staples in one convenient location. 
								So browse the mouth-watering produce, find out about producers and discover a feast of flavours - all at your leisure online.
								Just create and pay for your shopping list by midnight Thursday and we'll drop your shopping at your doorstep the following Monday. 
								Or you can pop in for 5 minutes to pick up your order as you're passing. Now that's convenience.
							</p>
							
							<h2>Plus Food for work</h2>							
							<p>
							We want to feed you well at work too. So we also deliver fresh fruit, milk, same day baked bread, 
							hand squeezed pure orange juice and pantry staples to workplaces in Wellington CBD or inner city suburbs as well.
							Every weekday. Simply order on line or call us on 04 3854200 to organise a weekly standing order.							
							</p>
